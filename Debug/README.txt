== DigDug++ -- Carver Anglin and Tyler Berry -- May 2015 ===================
============================================================================
This is the final project written entirely in C++ by Carver Anglin and 
Tyler Berry for Neumont University's C++ class.  

No external libraries or engines were used that aren't included in C++'s 
precompiled code.

Because of this, the only graphics available without using external 
libraries were very basic and drawing full squares and rectangles became 
relatively costly for the processor.
Thus, in order to run this game smoothly you will need a decent processor.
